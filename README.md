### Process

The interviewee will receive a link to this repository when the technical interview is scheduled.  The interviewee is
invited to check out the repository and review it at their leisure prior to the interview.  The interview will be 
conducted with the interviewee sharing their screen in a recorded zoom call.  The interviewee is requested to come ready
to make changes to the project of their choice (java, python, or typescript) by having the tools listed in the
project's README.md installed.  This recording will be shared internally for candidates who advance to the culture fit
interview, and it will be deleted once a hire/no hire decision is made.

The technical interview will be conducted according to the following rough schedule:

    -  2m    introductions
    - 15m    implement basic feature in the language of the project
    - 15m    implement basic improvement of the project build
    - 10m    discuss next steps, high level implementation and tradeoffs
    -  8m    discuss a project the candidate is proud of
    -  8m    discuss a disaster the candidate has caused
    -  2m    goodbyes
